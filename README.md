# insomnia-plugin-requests-desktop-notification

This is an Insomnia plugin which creates a new "Send All Requests" action in the dropdown menu for a folder. Selecting that option will have Insomnia send all the API requests in that folder and then display a desktop notification on your machine once all the requests have completed.

This may be useful when running a long set of requests and wanting to be notified once the job is complete.
